# files-to-markdown

This tool was primarily created by **o1 pro** as a quick and simple way to convert dropped files into Markdown-formatted code blocks. The motivation came from working with o1 models via ChatGPT, where constantly copying, pasting, and manually formatting code snippets became tedious and time-consuming.

## How It Works

1. Drag and drop one or more files onto the drop zone.
2. The tool will automatically read their contents, wrap them in fenced code blocks, and display them.

## Security & Privacy

There is no backend or server-side component, meaning your files are processed entirely in your browser. This should be safe in most scenarios since your data never leaves your machine, but you should still proceed at your own risk. If youâ€™re unsure or want complete control, you can always download the code and open the `index.html` file locally on your computer.

## Future Plans

- Consider turning this into a browser extension for even more convenience.
- Possibly integrate language detection or other enhancements as time goes on.
